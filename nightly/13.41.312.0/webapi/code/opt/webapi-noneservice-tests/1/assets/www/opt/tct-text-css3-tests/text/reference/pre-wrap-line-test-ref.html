<table><tr><td><div>Three cheers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for OldVet and the letter he wrote to Senator Dodd (see above Comment).&nbsp; We all need to be proactive and contact our senators and representatives to let them know our strong feelings on this subject. &nbsp;I would lose what little faith I have left in our government if they engineered a tax payer bailout.
